The ExploreWithMe app allows you to share information about interesting events, from exhibitions to movies, and help you find company to attend them.

The app consists of two services:

The main service - contains everything you need for the product to work.
Statistics service - stores the number of views and allows you to make various selections to analyze how the application works.
